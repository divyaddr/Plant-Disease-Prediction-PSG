# 🌱 **Plant Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

## 📌 **Overview**  
Plant diseases can significantly impact agricultural productivity. This project provides an **AI-driven solution** for detecting plant diseases using **image-based classification**. Leveraging **deep learning (CNNs) and machine learning (SVMs)**, the model identifies diseases, assesses severity, and suggests treatments with **94.8% accuracy**.  

## ✨ **Features**  
- 🔍 **Automated Plant Disease Detection** – Identify infections from leaf images  
- 📊 **Severity Analysis** – Assess how severely a plant is affected  
- 💡 **Remedial Suggestions** – Provides disease-specific treatments  
- 🎯 **High Accuracy** – Achieved **94.8% classification accuracy**  
- 📸 **User-Friendly** – Train and test the model with your own images  

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**  
- **📝 Language:** Python  
- **📚 Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras  
- **📊 Algorithms:**  
  - CNN for disease classification  
  - SVM for severity analysis  
- **🖼️ Dataset:** Kaggle’s Cotton Leaf Disease Dataset  
- **💻 Development Environment:** Google Colab  

## 📂 **Dataset Details**  
The dataset consists of **2,393 images** categorized into:  
- ✅ **Healthy**  
- 🦠 **Bacterial Spot**  
- 🍂 **Yellow Leaf Curl**  
- 🍁 **Late Blight**  

## 🔍 **Methodology**  
1️⃣ **Preprocessing** – Image augmentation, resizing, and normalization  
2️⃣ **Training** – CNN classifies diseases, SVM analyzes severity  
3️⃣ **Prediction** – Model identifies plant diseases from images  
4️⃣ **Recommendations** – Provides disease-specific remedies  

## ⚡ **Installation & Usage**  
### 📌 **Requirements**  
- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow & Keras  
- OpenCV & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  

### 📥 **Installation Steps**  
```sh
